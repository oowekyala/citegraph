# Citegraph


Generates easily readable citation graphs. This uses the contents
of a bibtex file to determine what you're interested in.

This uses the semanticscholar API to fetch references for articles.
Due to API rate limits this uses heuristics to only fetch potentially
interesting articles.

### Customizing graph appearance

TODO currently ad-hoc

Ideally, input a yaml file that contains additional tags for
each paper, and some styling information for that
