# Citegraph


Generates easily readable citation graphs. This uses the contents
of a bibtex file to determine what you're interested in.

This uses the semanticscholar API to fetch references for articles.

### Customizing graph appearance

TODO currently ad-hoc

Ideally, input a yaml file that contains additional tags for
each paper, and some styling information for that
